# ta_pipeline

Leakage-controlled **technical-analysis feature layer + label layer** for the
options-flow trade-idea model. Produces a per-ticker, per-bar feature matrix
plus ATR-scaled triple-barrier labels, ready to be joined (on `ticker` +
`date`) with separately-engineered flow / dark-pool features and fed into a
gradient-boosted classifier.

> **Status — complete (7 / 7 phases).** Candle ingestion (backfill / update / store), §3 indicators, swing
> detection, all §4 feature blocks, the §5 triple-barrier label layer, warmup
> masking, the `build_dataset` master builder and the §7 leakage test suite
> are all in place. Daily candles only; multi-timeframe (hourly / weekly) is
> deferred by design decision.

## Design principles

1. **Continuous, signed features over hand-cut booleans** — trees find their
   own thresholds. Where a categorical/ordinal feature is specified, its
   continuous companion is emitted alongside it.
2. **Cross-ticker comparable** — price magnitudes are normalized to ATR units;
   "extremeness" comes from trailing self-calibrating percentiles.
3. **Strict no-lookahead** — every feature at bar *t* uses only data through
   bar *t*. Trailing windows only, never full-sample statistics.
4. **Features describe the present; the label scores the future** — outcome
   information never enters a feature.

## Setup

```bash
cd ta_pipeline
python -m venv .venv && source .venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
export POLYGON_API_KEY=your_key_here
```

The §3 indicators are implemented directly in pandas/numpy (not via
`pandas-ta`): this gives exact, audited Wilder smoothing — the brief elevates
ATR correctness to the system's single most important alignment — and drops the
`numpy<2.0` pin `pandas-ta` would force. The one-function-per-indicator wrapper
keeps the library swappable.

## Candle ingestion

Daily OHLCV bars are pulled from Polygon.io into a local **parquet store** — one
file per ticker under `data/candles/{TICKER}.parquet` — with a CSV **manifest**
(`data/manifest.csv`) summarizing every ticker. The same store serves the
10-year TA-only baseline and the recent flow-overlap window — just different
`start` / `end` slices on `load_candles`.

### One-time backfill

```bash
export POLYGON_API_KEY=your_key_here
python -m ta_pipeline.ingestion.backfill --universe-file tickers.txt
```

Pulls the full 10 years of split-adjusted daily bars — one request per ticker,
up to 10 concurrent workers — runs the quality checks and writes the store +
manifest. `tickers.txt` is one symbol per line (or comma-separated; `#`
comments allowed). Use `--tickers AAPL,MSFT,NVDA` for an ad-hoc set, and
`--years` / `--data-dir` / `--workers` to override defaults. Re-running is safe
— each ticker's file is overwritten, which also refreshes split adjustments.

### Incremental daily update

```bash
python -m ta_pipeline.ingestion.update --universe-file tickers.txt
```

Reads each ticker's last stored date from the manifest, fetches only newer bars
and appends them (deduped on date). It is a ~200-row append — schedule it after
market close on whatever cron already runs your pipeline; no new infrastructure.
Tickers new to the universe are full-backfilled automatically.

> **Splits** — a split shifts historical split-adjusted prices. The updater does
> not re-adjust history; re-run the full backfill periodically (e.g. monthly) to
> keep adjustments current.

### Quality flags (manifest `qc_flags` column)

| Flag | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `empty` | Polygon returned no bars |
| `short_history` | first bar well after the requested start (IPO'd late — expected; actual start is recorded) |
| `stale` | last bar well before today (possible delisting or symbol change) |
| `gaps` | fewer trading days than expected for the date span |
| `zero_volume_rows` / `zero_price_rows` | suspicious zero/missing values present |
| `error:<Type>` | the fetch failed for this ticker |

Flags are advisory — issues are logged and recorded in the manifest, never
silently dropped.

## Quick start

```python
from ta_pipeline import PipelineConfig, load_candles_universe, build_dataset

cfg = PipelineConfig()                       # feature/label parameters (brief §6)

# candles come from the local parquet store (filled by the backfill job)
bars = load_candles_universe(["AAPL", "MSFT", "NVDA"],
                             start="2018-01-01", end="2024-12-31")

dataset = build_dataset(bars, cfg)           # features + triple-barrier labels;
                                             # warmup + unlabelable rows trimmed
```

`build_dataset(df, cfg, trim=False)` keeps every bar with the
`is_warmup` / `is_labelable` / `is_valid` flags intact — useful for inspection
and the leakage tests. `build_features(df, cfg)` runs the feature blocks only,
without labels.

## Pipeline stages

| Stage | Entry point | Output |
|---|---|---|
| Load | `load_candles` / `load_candles_universe` | adjusted daily OHLCV from the parquet store |
| Indicators (§3) | `compute_indicators` | RSI, Bollinger, ATR, TR, SMA, vol avg |
| Swings | `add_swings` | confirmed swing highs / lows (m=3, m=5) |
| Features (§4) | `add_*_features` | 61 feature columns |
| Label (§5) | `add_labels` | mirrored long/short triple-barrier labels |
| Warmup mask | `add_validity_flags` / `trim_to_valid` | model-ready matrix |

Every stage runs **per ticker** — no ticker's rolling window, swing sequence or
label horizon can cross into another's.

## Feature reference

61 feature columns. The 4 raw swing markers are **inspection-only** (centered,
future-peeking — see Leakage guarantees); the other 57 are model-ready.

## Label reference

ATR-scaled **triple barrier** on the underlying — entry `close[t]`, ATR pinned
to the entry bar, profit +1.5·ATR, stop −1.0·ATR, vertical barrier 10 trading
days, first touch wins. A bar touching both barriers counts as the stop
(pessimistic). No touch by the horizon → sign of the terminal return → a clean
binary classifier.

The barrier is **mirrored** — a long and a short — sharing the entry and ATR;
short is the long flipped (profit `-1.5 ATR`, stop `+1.0 ATR`). Each side is an
independent binary label. Emitted for each direction `d` in {`long`, `short`}:

| Column | Definition |
|---|---|
| `label_d` | binary {0, 1}; NaN if unlabelable (right edge) |
| `label_d_barrier` | `profit` / `stop` / `timeout` / None |
| `label_d_bars_to_outcome` | bars from entry to the first touch (or horizon) |
| `label_d_outcome_return` | the trade's directional return at the outcome bar (positive = the trade worked, both sides) |
| `terminal_return_{5,10,21}` | shared raw forward returns, for later DTE re-bucketing |

> **Horizon** — flow DTE is variable but under 30 calendar days, so a 10-trading-day
> (~2-week) barrier sits safely inside that cap. The extra `terminal_return_*`
> columns let the label be re-bucketed by DTE later without recomputing.

## Leakage guarantees

Each guarantee is enforced by a test in `tests/` (run `pytest`).

| Guarantee | Test |
|---|---|
| **Alignment** — a feature at *t* is unchanged when bars > *t* are deleted | `test_leakage_alignment.py` |
| **Trailing percentiles** — every `*_pctile` uses only its trailing window, never the full sample, never a partial window | `test_trailing_percentile.py` |
| **ATR consistency** — the labeler's ATR is the identical Wilder ATR(14) the features use | `test_atr_consistency.py` |
| **Label separation** — features read bars ≤ *t*; the label outcome reads (t, t+horizon]; no overlap | `test_label_separation.py` |
| **Warmup masking** — the ~266-bar warmup region and unlabelable right edge are dropped; no half-formed value survives | `test_warmup.py` |
| **Labeler correctness** — barrier touches, first-touch-wins, tie-break, timeout | `test_labeler.py` |
| **Cross-ticker isolation** — a ticker's features are identical computed alone vs. in a universe | `test_leakage_alignment.py` |

The **raw swing markers** (`swing_high/low_m{3,5}`) are centered — they use *m*
bars *after* the pivot — so they intentionally fail the alignment test and are
excluded from the feature set. Only the confirmation-aligned `*_conf` columns,
which appear at bar `p+m`, are leakage-safe to consume.

## Configuration & the parameter sweep

`PipelineConfig` ([config.py](config.py)) is the single source of truth for
every brief §6 parameter. Construct with no arguments for the defaults; override
fields for a sweep variant, e.g. `PipelineConfig(swing_m=5)`.

Four parameters are genuinely universe-dependent and meant to be **swept** under
walk-forward CV; everything else is fixed by convention to keep
multiple-comparisons risk low. The sweep set and its grids:

| `SWEEP_PARAMS` | Default | `SWEEP_PARAM_RANGES` |
|---|---|---|
| `swing_m` | 3 | 2–6 |
| `breach_recency_N` | 5 | 3–8 |
| `consolidation_K` | 20 | 15–40 |
| `channel_tightness_c` | 4.0 | 3–6 |

Label parameters (`label_horizon`, `label_profit_atr`, `label_stop_atr`) **define
the problem** — they are fixed by reasoning and never optimized for backtest
return.

### Running the sweep under walk-forward CV

```python
import itertools
from ta_pipeline import PipelineConfig, SWEEP_PARAM_RANGES, build_dataset

for m, n, k, c in itertools.product(*SWEEP_PARAM_RANGES.values()):
    cfg = PipelineConfig(swing_m=m, breach_recency_N=n,
                         consolidation_K=k, channel_tightness_c=c)
    dataset = build_dataset(bars, cfg)            # leakage-controlled matrix

    # Walk-forward: sort by date, train on an expanding past window, validate
    # on the *next* time block only — never shuffle, never train on the future.
    # Score with PR-AUC (classes are imbalanced). Reserve a final untouched
    # out-of-sample period and look at it exactly once.
```

Because the four swept parameters are noise-tolerant, the first run should
sweep only these and leave the convention-grounded parameters fixed.

## Model — TA-only baseline

`model/` trains the TA-only baseline classifier on the feature matrix — the
ablation the project is measured against (per the brief: if the combined
TA + flow model can't beat this, the TA layer is dead weight).

```bash
python -m ta_pipeline.model.run        # matrix is cached; trains 12 models (~1 min)
```

`materialize_matrix` (build + cache the matrix from the candle store) →
`oof_predictions` (walk-forward LightGBM per side, isotonic-calibrated) →
`build_predictions_table` + `evaluate`. Artifacts land in `data/models/`:

| Artifact | What |
|---|---|
| `predictions.parquet` / `.csv` | per (ticker, date): `p_long` / `p_short`, entry / target / stop, and the **actual outcome** — the spot-check table |
| `evaluation.csv` | PR-AUC, ROC-AUC, Brier, top-decile precision/recall — per side, CV vs OOS |
| `ta_only_{long,short}.joblib` | the OOS-fold models, trained on all development data |

**Validation discipline** — walk-forward only: expanding-window CV folds plus a
final 12-month out-of-sample slice, with a 10-day embargo between train and
test so a training row's forward label never leaks into its test block. The
OOS PR-AUC is the headline benchmark.

The predictions table answers "would this have been a good long / short
entry": sort by `p_long` (or `p_short`) for the day's top candidates; every row
carries what actually happened (`label_*_barrier` = profit / stop / timeout,
the realized return, days-to-outcome), so predictions are directly
spot-checkable. Two binary models — long and short are independent.

## Running the tests

```bash
cd ta_pipeline && pytest           # 20 tests, ~0.5s, all synthetic data
```

### Downstream — the flow / dark-pool join (`flow/`)

The Unusual Whales flow + Polygon dark-pool feature join is **built** — see
[flow/README.md](flow/README.md). It extracts both tables from the Railway
Postgres, engineers per-(ticker, date) features under a close-aligned join
(Rule A), joins them onto this matrix, and runs the model ablations.

- **Dark-pool ablation — measured.** TA vs dark-pool vs combined on the 2023+
  window: the dark-pool features add a marginal, consistent ~+0.01 OOS
  ROC-AUC — still ≈ chance. A block print is direction-agnostic, so it was
  always a weak directional predictor.
- **Flow ablation — guard-gated.** UW serves only a rolling ~30-trading-day
  window, so the flow corpus is far too short to model honestly. The runner
  refuses until it matures; `run_ablation.py --flow` is then a one-command
  rerun. The flow README's roadmap covers the event-grain / ranking rebuild.

### Still deferred

- Multi-timeframe (hourly / weekly) candles — the pipeline is daily-only.
- The `lambdarank` ranking variant — folded into the flow-model roadmap.
